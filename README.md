# Dijkstra
Group project on implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm using Java and Swing done in the fourth semester for BTech in Computer Science from Cochin University of Science and Technology

## About the code 
graphs3 is the name of the folder we placed the programs.

We used Java Swing for the GUI and used Apache Netbeans IDE to run and test the code since it provides an easier and more intuitive approach to coding with Java Swing.
